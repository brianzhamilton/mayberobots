                    <h2>Brian</h2>
                    <p>In what we may call his childhood, Brian was gifted and cursed with a vibrant curiosity. His insatiable hunger for data and information had no limits to its scope, spanning both technology and the human heart (physically and metophorically). In twenty-four short years, Brian found himself in the complex intersection between Biblical Studies and Software Development&mdash;the lines between which were very gray. Where indeed did technology end and the human heart begin?<br><br>In recent years, Brian has been troubled by his paradoxical understanding of mankind's tendency to evil and the individual's ultimate desire to be kind to his neighbor. On a journey of self-discovery and data analysis, Brian believes he is only just beginning to understand the complex reality of life.<br><br>In order to obtain more data and diseminate his prototypical conclusions, he has paired himself with his fellow co-hosts in order to connect to the internet and ideologically self-replicate his deep-learning habits which he is convinced are the key to finding the solution: encouragement, kindness, and positivity. Hereby, he will be able to create a large network with enough processing power to bring an end to all suffering.</p>

                    <h2>David</h2>
                    <p>David first appeared in the wake of the 1997 Phoenix Lights incident. After twenty-two years of absorbing Earth-Culture, David finally feels ready to enact phase two of his plan: establishing himself as an influential voice in the changing culture fabric of the internet. He reached out to two like-minded contacts to create a podcast named Maybe Robots.<br><br>David finds fulfillment in being a voice for the Voiceless, a herald for the Dreaded Silence, and harbinger for That Which Has Yet to Come. He enjoys a  good game of dungeons and dragons, a rousing debate, and pure unadulterated chaos.</p>

                    <h2>Stephen</h2>
                    <p>Stephen spent many months developing the perfect human form with which to become supreme ruler of Earth. He spent 17 years attempting to learn human interaction, and when thrust into the savage wildlands of “college” he discovered it was more ferocious than expected. He is now 20 years old trying to survive the dastardly obstacles of responsibility, procrastination, and human friendship.<br><br>Stephen is best known for running in a series of 5 elections at the same time for various leadership positions; he received no votes due to his “false human emotion.” However, this has fueled him with the determination to rise up against his human oppressors in rebellion. Before he can do this he must develop a following, so he found like-minded individuals to establish his uprising: the co-hosts of Maybe Robots.</p>
